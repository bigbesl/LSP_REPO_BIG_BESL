##Question 1: Cohesion Analysis
#AI Role: Software Design Mentor

#Provided conceptual framework using Arthur Riel's heuristics

#Analyzed code structure against object-oriented principles

#Explained the difference between high and low cohesion

#Suggested refactoring strategies for better design

#Question 2: AreaCalculator Implementation
#AI Role: Code Implementation Assistant

#Generated syntactically correct Java code with method overloading

#Ensured mathematical formulas were accurate

#Added proper exception handling as specified

#Helped with file structure organization

#Provided design rationale for method overloading approach

#Question 3: Car Manufacturer UML
#AI Role: System Design Consultant

#Analyzed inheritance hierarchy flaws in UML diagram

#Proposed composition-based solution using Strategy pattern

#Explained trade-offs between inheritance and composition

#Provided refactored class structure with clear justifications

#Question 4: Smart-Campus Device System
#AI Role: Complex System Architect

#Implemented multiple classes adhering to strict specifications

#Managed interface contracts and abstract class inheritance

#Ensured proper use of polymorphism and encapsulation

#Integrated provided driver code without modifications

#Added design rationale explaining architectural decisions

#Question 5: File Structure Guidance
#AI Role: Development Environment Helper

#Diagnosed project structure issues in Eclipse

#Provided step-by-step instructions for correct setup

#Explained Java package-to-directory mapping requirements

#Offered IDE-specific troubleshooting guidance

#Overall AI Usage Pattern:
#The AI served as an adaptive learning partner that shifted roles based on task requirements:

#Conceptual understanding for design questions

#Code generation for implementation tasks

#Debugging assistance for structural issues

#Explanation provider for theoretical concepts

#This demonstrates how AI can complement human problem-solving by handling routine implementation details while the learner focuses on higher-level design decisions and conceptual mastery. The interaction shows a collaborative approach where AI provides immediate feedback and multiple solution perspectives, enabling deeper engagement with complex software engineering concepts.
